High in responsibility, Strategic thinking, and vision. 

**Teamwork Paper:**

Like I said on my teamwork paper I believe that Communication,  Conflict resolution, and find grace together are critical portions of an teams DNA. It's important to realize that the team is a single unit that lives and dies together not a function of it's parts but by the sum of all of the people and experiences therein.  I got 100 on the paper so I assume I don't have issues with it per say but I do want to consider these things with our own team as we work on our project together.
