- Teamwork Qualities: Trust, Communication, Cooperation
  - For trust, I will trust that my teammates are capable of handling the task at hand and hope they extend the same courtesy.
  - For communication, I will communicate when I cannot handle a task in a timely manner, or not capable, or simply that I will be working ahead on a feature.
  - For cooperation, I will consult my teammates for all project decisions and let them know that I am open to help if anybody needs me.
